#WPILibPixy
<hr>
The objective of this project is to make it much easier for teams to interface with the Pixy cam. 
I can't really confirm the functionality of this library right now, but I hope within the next couple of months
to have some people to help me hash out the bugs that will almost certainly appear so this can be translated to both C++
and LabVIEW. Please feel free to contribute something new or work on things from the To Do List! I won't always have time to 
work on this, so any help is greatly appreciated. Bug reports are also helpful, even if you don't know how to fix the library 
itself just letting someone know that there's actually a problem will at the very least get it looked at, rather than having it 
sit there and cause problems.

<h3>To Do List (In no real particular order, I'll be coming at it from the top down the best I can)</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
	<li>Test UART</li>
	<li>Test I2C</li>
	<li>Test SPI (See the TODO markers littered about the project on this one, the SPI communication is weird)</li>
	<li>C++ Translation</li>
	<li>LabVIEW Translation</li>
	<li>Multiple Pixys At Once?</li>
	<li>Create Native Bindings to libpixyusb?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Contributing to the Project</h3>

<ul>
	<li>COMMENTS, COMMENTS, COMMENTS</li>
	<li>Keep your code clean, appropriate white-spacing, brackets, etc.</li>
	<li>Commits and Pull Requests should clearly define what you're changing and why, it'll help when dealing with translations later</li>
	<li>Seriously though, write comments...</li>
