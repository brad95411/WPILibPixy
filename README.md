While I suspect there will be some teams who continue to use the PixyCam, the Limelight camera is much better in terms of usability and already comes with libraries available. Another contributing factor is the main github for PixyCam is sparsely updated, it does not seem like the team who initially created it wishes to continue work on it. 

I may try to finish the Java version of this library if I find the spare time, but right now it doesn't seem worth it given the quality of the camera itself and the laxidasical nature of the team working on it.

The objective of this project is to make it much easier for teams to interface with the Pixy cam. 
I can't really confirm the functionality of this library right now, but I hope within the next couple of months
to have some people to help me hash out the bugs that will almost certainly appear so this can be translated to both C++
and LabVIEW. Please feel free to contribute something new or work on things from the To Do List! I won't always have time to 
work on this, so any help is greatly appreciated. Bug reports are also helpful, even if you don't know how to fix the library 
itself just letting someone know that there's actually a problem will at the very least get it looked at, rather than having it 
sit there and cause problems.
